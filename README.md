# Societal Biases in Survivor

Exploratory data analysis project assessing demographic representation in CBS Survivor. Completed for Data Science with R 1 final project (Northwestern University, December 2024).

Implements data cleaning and visualization skills learned in DSwR1.

This project has been duplicated and relocated to my personal public GitHub repository. Minor changes were made to remove unnecessary components related to the course for ease of understanding for non-university affiliated viewers, but all of the original code and final outputs have been preserved. This repository only reflects the changes made during the relocation process; therefore, none of the commits relate to the original creation of this project's form and content.
